# Kratos_DEM_Basic_Tutorial_Gitbook

I plan to write a simple tutorial for Kratos DEM.

There are two reasons: 

(1) Writting it down can help myself remember it for a longer time.

(2) Maybe this can help the beginner who want to use Kratos DEM to run their cases.

I do not really have too much time to do this.

But I will keep update it once I have time.
